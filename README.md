developing a GUI using turtle graphics, python and tkinter for the game concentration

It was hoped to have finished the game by now but stuck on getting the cards to flip more than once and for the matches to be recognized properly.  Any help is greatly appreciated... this requires python 3.8, tkinter and turtle.py.
