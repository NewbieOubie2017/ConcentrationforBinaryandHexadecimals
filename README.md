developing a GUI using turtle graphics, python and tkinter for the game concentration

Now the program is working a minor bug in that sometimes a square goes blank after being matched up.  Also the board does not redraw on the second game.  Thank you so very much for your interest.  Any help is greatly appreciated... this requires python 3.8, tkinter and turtle.py.
