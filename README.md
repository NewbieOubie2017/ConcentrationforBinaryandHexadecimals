# ConcentrationforBinaryandHexadecimals
developing a GUI using turtle graphics, python and tkinter for the game concentration

Now the program is working a minor bug in that sometimes a square goes blank after being matched up.  Also the board does not redraw on the second game.  Thank you so very much for your interest.  Any help is greatly appreciated... this requires python 3.8, tkinter and turtle.py.

When I was designing the program I thought players would convert the bin and hex numbers into decimal and that is why I choose to start with easy 0 for the second digit of hex as easiest numbers 0-15, then 10 or 1010 in bin and a in hex so numbers 160-175 and then harder 15, or 1111 bin and f in hex numbers 240-255.Â  But when I was playing while debugging the program I found I just converted bin to hex and tried to remember the location so I did get better at recognizing binary 1010 to 1111 but did not translate the bin and hex into decimal.  to add more numbers is easy when you or your students are ready.
